You should now be able to:

Discuss blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT).
Explore permissioned and permissionless blockchains and their key characteristics.
Discuss various components of distributed ledger technologies, including consensus algorithms and smart contracts.
Provide a high-level explanation of what Hyperledger is.

For a new technology to realize its full potential, a lot of pieces need to exist before network effects can be realized. Moreover, in order for the technology to bring in systemic efficiencies, a critical mass needs to be attained. As an infrastructure technology, all major players in the market need to collaborate to define standards in a democratic manner. The blockchain community is indeed witnessing unprecedented levels of industry collaboration between players who are otherwise competitors in the space. Because of the cost of moving from one infrastructure technology to the next, an open source collaborative approach is the most promising way forward. As you will learn in Chapter 2, Introduction to Hyperledger, Hyperledger's mandate is to develop and nurture this ecosystem to develop the future of business blockchain technologies.
